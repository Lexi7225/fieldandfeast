            <h2>Welcome to Field & Feast</h2>
            <p>
                At Field & Feast, we believe that the finest meals begin at the source. Rooted in tradition yet refined for
                the modern palate, our farm-to-table philosophy celebrates the beauty of seasonality, sustainability, and
                craftsmanship. From the sun-drenched fields where our produce is grown to the artfully curated dishes we
                serve, every detail is designed to bring you an experience of unparalleled quality and flavor.
